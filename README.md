Config files

NeoVim config stolen from this video [ThePrimeagen's "0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)

# Prerequisites
 - Neovim
 - Ripgrep
 - You need to set up your SSH key to your own Github account or the mason
 installs will fail
 - xclip for clipboard access (I haven't figured it out for ssh though)

# NOTES
 - I had to comment out the bash_profile TERM set for tmux to show colors properly
 - I have some code in tmux config
